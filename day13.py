    The solution to the game can be expressed as two equations:
      1.  (number of A presses) * (a button distance_x) + (numbmer of B presses) * (b button distance_x) = Prize_x
      2.  (number of A presses) * (a button distance_y) + (numbmer of B presses) * (b button distance_y) = Prize_y

    Using algebra, we can solve for number of B presses, and then for number of A presses (or the other way around, but hey):
        1. b_presses = (prize_y * abutton_x - prize_x * abutton_y) / (abutton_x * bbutton_y - abutton_y * bbutton_x)
        2. a_presses = (prize_x - bbutton_x * b_presses) / abutton_x

    When solutions to b_presses or a_presses are fractional, it suggests an unsolvable game (it would require part of
    a press of the button to get the solution).
